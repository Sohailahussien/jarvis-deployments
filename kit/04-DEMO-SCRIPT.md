## Script 1: Executive Briefing (15 Minutes)

**Audience**: C-Suite, VPs, Department Heads
**Goal**: Demonstrate strategic value and ROI
**Focus**: Business outcomes, cost savings, competitive advantage

### Opening (2 minutes)

"Good morning/afternoon. Thank you for taking the time today.

Let me start with a question: How much water do you lose before it reaches your customers? Industry data shows GCC water utilities lose between 15-35% through distribution inefficiencies. For a utility your size, that could represent $15-40 million in annual losses.

What if you could reduce that by half within 6 months?

That's what facilis.ai makes possible. We're an AI-powered platform that turns your operational data into actionable intelligence - instantly.

Today, I'm going to show you three things that typically take weeks of analysis work - and we'll do them in the next 10 minutes."

### Demo 1: Non-Revenue Water Analysis (4 minutes)

**[Upload distribution-network-performance.csv]**

"Let me show you what we can do with your distribution network data.

**[Paste Prompt 2A from demo prompts]**

While facilis.ai analyzes 8 months of network data, let me explain what's happening. The AI is:
- Calculating water loss by zone
- Identifying pressure anomalies that indicate leaks
- Analyzing flow patterns to detect abnormal consumption
- Prioritizing zones for immediate investigation
- Calculating your financial recovery potential

**[Review results when complete]**

Here's what the AI found: You're losing approximately 28% of your water - about $8.2 million annually. But look at this breakdown by zone. Zone C-South alone accounts for 40% loss. That's your target.

The AI has prioritized 8 zones for immediate investigation, with an estimated recovery potential of $4.5 million in the first year.

This analysis would normally take your team 2-3 weeks. We just did it in 90 seconds."

### Demo 2: Energy Cost Optimization (4 minutes)

**[Upload energy-usage.csv]**

"Now let's look at energy - typically your second-largest operating expense.

**[Paste Prompt 3A from demo prompts]**

The AI is analyzing your energy consumption patterns across all facilities, comparing to industry benchmarks, identifying inefficiencies, and modeling optimization scenarios.

**[Review results]**

Look at this: Your North Pumping Station is running 25% less efficiently than it should. Your Desalination Plant has degraded 8% over the past 8 months. And you're hitting peak demand charges that could be avoided with simple load shifting.

Total opportunity: $3.2 million in annual energy savings.

The AI has provided a prioritized action plan - some require zero capital, just operational adjustments. Others require equipment upgrades, but with 6-month payback periods.

Again, this would normally take weeks of engineering analysis. We just delivered it instantly."

### Demo 3: Integrated Dashboard (3 minutes)

**[Upload all datasets]**

"Let me show you one more thing. What if all your operational data - quality, network, energy, maintenance, customers - was unified in one intelligent system?

**[Paste Prompt 8A from demo prompts]**

The AI is now building an integrated performance dashboard that connects insights across all operational areas.

**[Review results]**

This is powerful. The AI found 12 interconnected opportunities worth $12-18 million annually. It's showing you exactly where to focus for maximum impact.

More importantly, this isn't a one-time analysis. This becomes your living operations intelligence center, updating in real-time as new data arrives."

### Closing (2 minutes)

"So, in 12 minutes, we've identified:
- $4.5M in water loss recovery
- $3.2M in energy savings
- $12-18M in total opportunities

And we did analysis that would take your team months - instantly.

This is what facilis.ai delivers: AI-powered intelligence that drives operational excellence and financial performance.

Three things I want you to remember:
1. **Speed**: Insights in minutes, not months
2. **Intelligence**: AI finds patterns humans miss
3. **Action**: Prioritized recommendations, not just reports

The question isn't whether you need this. The question is: How much longer can you afford to operate without it?

I'd like to propose a pilot program - 30 days, focused on your highest-priority challenge. We'll prove the value before you make any long-term commitment.

What questions do you have?"

## Script 2: Technical Deep Dive (30 Minutes)

**Audience**: IT Managers, Engineers, Operations Managers
**Goal**: Demonstrate technical capabilities and integration
**Focus**: Data handling, analytics depth, implementation

### Opening (3 minutes)

"Thank you for the opportunity to present today.

I understand you've been evaluating solutions for data analytics and operational optimization. What makes facilis.ai different is that we're not just another BI tool or enterprise software package.

We're an AI agent platform that thinks like your best analyst, works 24/7, and gets smarter over time.

Today I'm going to show you:
1. How we handle complex, real-world data
2. The depth of our analytical capabilities
3. How quickly you can build custom applications
4. How we integrate with your existing systems

Let's dive in."

### Demo 1: Data Integration & Quality Analysis (5 minutes)

**[Show CSV files]**

"First, let's talk about data. These are synthetic datasets I've brought that mirror typical water utility operations:
- 69,000 water quality measurements
- 46,000 network performance records
- 52,000 energy consumption data points
- 10,000 maintenance records
- 40,000 customer consumption records

This is realistic operational data - time-series, multiple parameters, messy real-world patterns.

**[Upload water-quality-monitoring.csv]**

Let me show you how facilis.ai handles this.

**[Paste Prompt 1A]**

Notice I'm not writing SQL queries or building data models. I'm asking questions in plain English. The AI understands:
- The data structure and relationships
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Statistical analysis needs
- Visualization requirements

**[Review results]**

Look at the depth here. The AI:
- Automatically identified 47 regulatory exceedances
- Correlated quality issues with time patterns
- Ranked monitoring stations by performance
- Flagged the August 15th incident we embedded in the data
- Provided actionable recommendations

This is production-quality analysis, not basic charts."

### Demo 2: Root Cause Analysis (5 minutes)

**[Continue with water quality data]**

"Now let's do what your engineers do - investigate an incident.

**[Paste Prompt 1B - Turbidity Investigation]**

The AI is performing multi-variable correlation analysis, building a timeline, assessing impact, and determining root cause.

**[Review results]**

This is impressive. The AI:
- Pinpointed the exact start time of the incident
- Identified which stations were affected
- Correlated with pressure and flow data
- Hypothesized the root cause (upstream disturbance)
- Recommended preventive measures

This is the kind of analysis that takes your team days of data mining. We're doing it in real-time."

### Demo 3: Predictive Analytics (6 minutes)

**[Upload maintenance-records.csv]**

"Let's look at predictive capabilities.

**[Paste Prompt 4A - Asset Failure Prediction]**

The AI is building failure prediction models based on historical patterns, calculating risk scores, and optimizing your maintenance strategy.

**[Review results]**

Here's what's powerful:
- 73 assets flagged at high risk of failure in next 90 days
- Probability estimates for each asset
- Financial impact of preventive vs. reactive maintenance
- Optimized maintenance schedule

The AI identified that you're spending $2.8M annually on emergency repairs. By implementing predictive maintenance, you could reduce that by 60% - saving $1.7M.

And look at this breakdown by asset type. Pumps have a failure pattern related to age and operating hours. The AI built a remaining useful life model automatically."

### Demo 4: Multi-Source Integration (6 minutes)

**[Upload all remaining datasets]**

"Now the real power - integrating multiple data sources for interconnected insights.

**[Paste Prompt 8A - Integrated Dashboard]**

The AI is now analyzing across six different datasets, finding relationships between operational areas, and building a unified performance view.

**[Review results]**

This is where facilis.ai shines. Look at these interconnected insights:

- High water loss in Zone C correlates with high complaint rates
- Energy inefficiency at North Pumping Station is causing pressure issues
- Customer billing spikes correlate with network pressure changes
- Maintenance delays are impacting quality compliance

These are the insights you can't get from siloed systems. This is systems thinking, delivered by AI."

### Demo 5: Custom Application Building (3 minutes)

"One more thing. Let me show you how fast you can build custom applications.

Watch this: 'Build me a real-time water quality dashboard that shows all monitoring stations, highlights any parameter exceeding regulatory limits, and sends alerts when issues occur.'

**[Demonstrate app building capability]**

In minutes, you have a production-ready application. Your team can do this - no coding required. That's the power of AI-driven development."

### Closing (2 minutes)

"So, what have we shown you today?

**Technical Capabilities**:
- Handles complex, multi-source data
- Production-quality analytics and visualizations
- Predictive modeling and machine learning
- Natural language interface
- Custom application development

**Integration**:
- Works with your existing data sources

Think of it as having a data analyst on your team 24/7, who can answer any question about your operations in seconds.

Let me show you what I mean."

### Demo 1: Daily Operations Briefing (4 minutes)

**[Upload all datasets]**

"Every morning, you probably check multiple systems - SCADA, quality reports, work orders, customer complaints. What if you could ask one question and get a complete briefing?

Let me ask the AI: 'Give me a daily operations briefing for today. What issues need my attention?'

**[Show automated briefing response]**

Look at this:
- Quality alert: Station 12 chlorine dropping
- Network alert: Zone C showing abnormal night flow (likely leak)
- Energy alert: Peak demand trending up
- Maintenance: 3 high-priority assets need attention
- Customer: 12 new complaints in Zone H (pressure issues)

Everything you need to know, in one place, in 30 seconds.

This is what facilis.ai does - it monitors everything and tells you what matters."

### Demo 2: Problem Investigation (5 minutes)

**[Focus on water quality data]**

"Let's say you get a call from a customer complaining about water taste. You need to investigate fast.

Instead of pulling up SCADA, checking logs, comparing to historical data manually, just ask:

'Analyze water quality at Station 5 for the past 7 days. Are there any issues?'

**[Show AI analysis]**

Instantly, you have:
- Chlorine levels trending down
- Increased turbidity events
- Correlation with specific time periods
- Possible causes
- Recommended actions

This investigation that would take you an hour just took 2 minutes."

### Demo 3: Maintenance Planning (4 minutes)

**[Show maintenance records]**

"Planning maintenance is tough - limited budget, competing priorities, risk management.

Let me ask: 'Which assets should I prioritize for maintenance this month based on failure risk and impact?'

**[Show prioritized list]**

The AI analyzed historical failures, asset age, operational stress, and downtime impact. It's giving you a prioritized list with justification.

Pump-0234: 85% failure probability, critical service impact - schedule immediately.
Valve-0891: 60% probability, medium impact - schedule this month.
Meter-1456: 40% probability, low impact - can wait.

This is data-driven maintenance planning - protecting service while managing your budget."

### Demo 4: Customer Service Support (3 minutes)

**[Show customer data]**

"Dealing with customer complaints about high bills? Let me show you something helpful.

'Identify customers likely to receive high bills next month so I can notify them proactively.'

**[Show analysis]**

The AI identified 147 customers with consumption spikes. It's flagging:
- 23 with likely leaks at premises
- 18 with meter reading issues
- 106 with normal high usage (summer irrigation)

Now you can call these customers before they call you - proactive service.

'Mr. Johnson, we noticed your water usage spiked last month. Would you like us to help you check for leaks?'

That's the kind of service that builds customer loyalty."

### Demo 5: Reporting Made Easy (2 minutes)

"Last thing - reporting. I know you spend hours preparing reports for management.

Watch this: 'Generate a weekly operations summary report with key metrics, issues, and actions taken.'

**[Show generated report]**

Complete report, ready to send. Charts, tables, summary, recommendations.

This report that takes you 3 hours every week? Now it's 3 minutes."

### Closing (1 minute)

"So here's what facilis.ai does for operations teams:

- Instant answers to any operational question
- Proactive problem detection
- Data-driven prioritization
- Better customer service
- Automated reporting

It's not replacing you - it's making you more effective. You still make the decisions. The AI just gives you better information, faster.

I'd love to set this up for a 30-day trial where you can ask it anything about your operations. See how it helps your daily work.
